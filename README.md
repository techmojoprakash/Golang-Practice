## Demos / Exercises
To follow along with the demos & work on the exercises, open the `src/lectures` directory in your IDE.
Demo source files are available in `src/lectures/demo` and coding excercises are available in `src/lectures/exercise`.
When your terminal is in the `src/lectures` directory, demos can be ran using `go run ./demo/demo-name` and exercises can be ran using `go run ./exercise/exercise-name`.

## Solutions
To view solutions for the exercises and projects, checkout the `solutions` branch using `git checkout solutions` (you may need to commit or stash your changes to switch branches).
The `solutions` branch also includes the code seen in the demos.
